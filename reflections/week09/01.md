## Questions

1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?
We used Vue a javascript frame work to build the whole front end. We also used node.js to back the backend. We didnt use any external APIS to grab any data.
2. What went well so far?
When we had ideas that were set in stone, we finished them very quick and got a lot done quickly
3. What would you do differently? Why?
If we had more of a soild plan coming in with a clear vision of the app it would have went a lot smoother. We spent a lot of time deciding how we wanted to do things and how to proceed.
