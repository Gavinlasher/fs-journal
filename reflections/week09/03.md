## Questions

1. What is a Base64 Encoded Image?
Base64 provided a way of working around that by using an already open HTTP connection to deliver images embedded directly into the HTML or CSS. 
2. What are the drawbacks of using Base64 Encoding?

multiplexing that arrived with HTTP/2, web browsers have become incredibly efficient in delivering hundreds of files through a single connection. Which made this method no longer viable.

3. Why are these drawbacks issues in this day and age versus in the past?
The files are still 25% bigger on avg and take more time to load. it does local store them so the server request is much bigger as well.
