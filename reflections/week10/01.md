## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?
Value type data types directly contain values.
Reference type  it stores the address where the value is being stored. In other words, a reference type contains a pointer to another memory location that holds the data.
Pointer type A pointer cannot point to a reference or to a struct that contains references, because an object reference can be garbage collected even if a pointer is pointing to it. 
2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?
bool
byte
char
decimal
double
enum
float
int
long
sbyte
short
struct
uint
ulong
ushort
focus more memory and can only equal that type

3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?

reference type stores the address of the location where the actual value is stored instead of the value itself.
