## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?


Columns contain the column name, data type, and any other attributes for the column. Rows contain the records or data for the columns.
2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, 
and an `int` id.

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS characters(
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT primary key,
  name text,
  age int,
description text,
) default charset utf8 COMMENT '';


3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;
```
one drops the whole table and the other you can select where you want to delete
