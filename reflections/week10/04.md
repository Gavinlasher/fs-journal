## Questions

1. What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?

Enums are strongly typed constants. They are essentially unique types that allow you to assign symbolic names to integral values.
You should always use enums when a variable (especially a method parameter) can only take one out of a small set of possible values.

2. How can you modify an Enum?
Enum base types can be changed and member values can be specified

3. How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)
using System;

namespace MyApplication
{
  enum Level
  {
    Low,
    Medium,
    High
  }
  class Program
  {
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      Level myVar = Level.High;
      Console.WriteLine(myVar);
    }
  }
}
