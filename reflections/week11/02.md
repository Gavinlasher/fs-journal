## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `primary key` and a `foreign key`
primary key is the id of that table the main id and foreign key ref another id 
2. What is an `Alias`?
Type aliasing is a little known feature for C# and it comes in handy when you would like to alias a specific method or class from a namespace for the sake of clarity. At the heart of these features is the using keyword.
3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)
SELECT * FROM doctors WHERE doctor.id = doctorId and patient.id = patientId
